      A joke website as <b>FaceMash for "uni"-versities</b>. The original FaceMash (created by Mark
      Zuckerberg) was aggressively mean, but highly effective in stirring humans to their primitive
      instincts of judgement; kinda sad how that works.

      This is a somewhat satirical re-creation but also a fun exercise for creating dynamic websites
      with an external database. Also, this website looks terrible on purpose!
