# unimash

A joke website as **FaceMash for "uni"-versities**. The original FaceMash
was aggressively mean, but highly effective in stirring humans to their primitive
instincts of judgement; kinda sad how that works. This will be a somewhat satirical
re-creation, but also an exercise for creating dynamic websites with external databases.

Even though it has some innaccuracies, _The Social Network_ is pretty epic.

## Dev Notes

- Probably using this to test out mongoDB and storage buckets for images. (AWS?)
- Simple styling!!!! Thank goodness that CSS in 2003 was pretty awful
- I debugged setting up mongodb for two hours until I realized that I pasted the URI wrong
- using Wikipedia as the [Elo rating reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Theory) for pairwise comparisons
- yolo badge?
