# unimash

A joke website as **FaceMash for "uni"-versities**. The original FaceMash 
was aggressively mean, but highly effective in stirring humans to their primitive 
instincts of judgement; kinda sad how that works. This will be a somewhat satirical 
re-creation, but also an exercise for creating dynamic websites with external databases.

Even though it has some innaccuracies, *The Social Network* is pretty epic.

## Dev Notes

- Probably using this to test out mongoDB and storage buckets for images. (AWS?)
- Simple styling!!!! Thank goodness that CSS in 2003 was pretty awful
